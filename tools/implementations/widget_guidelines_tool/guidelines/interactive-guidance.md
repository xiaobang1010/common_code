# Interactive Guidance
- Use HTML for the interactive controls — sliders, buttons, live state displays, charts.
- Keep prose explanations in your normal response text, not embedded in the HTML.
- Handle filtering, sorting, toggling, and calculations in JS instead. Use `sendPrompt()` only when the user's next step benefits from the model thinking.
- For steppers: show all content stacked vertically during streaming. Post-streaming JS-driven steppers are fine.
- For cycles: HTML stepper with `● ○ ○` position indicator. Next wraps from the last stage back to the first.
